                <p>Allow me to introduce myself.
                    I am a South Korean native who graduated with a degree in Computer Science and relocated to America
                    after tying the knot.
                    I have a deep passion for software development and currently seeking employment in America as a
                    developer.
                    My primary area of interest lies in crafting web applications as I find it both challenging and
                    fulfilling.
                    <br><br>
                    I first discovered my love for programming during my sophomore year of college when I created a
                    desktop application
                    that provided freshmen with essential information about our institution. During the project, I
                    encountered an issue with crawling website images but
                    managed to solve it by importing a form that takes an image source. This experience ignited my
                    fascination with programming,
                    leading me down the path to become a passionate developer.
                    <br><br>
                    In summary, I am a motivated and determined individual with a background in computer science,
                    seeking opportunities to contribute my problem-solving
                    abilities to the world of software development.
